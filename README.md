## Project Description
The objective of this project was to develop a backend for an e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies. The backend includes the database for all products, categories and tags. It also includes *API* routes for products, categories and tags; utilizing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) methodology to perform specific tasks following the user's input.  

The project was developed using *Express.JS* and *Node.Js*. It also incorporated code libraries such as *Sequelize*, *mysql2*, *dotenv* e.t.c. The backend was tested using *Insomnia*. Working on this project exposed me to several new concepts especially the significance of Express.JS. I learnt how to apply the concepts such as *Object Relational Mapping*, models on *Sequelize* and handling errors using `async` and `await`.

## Usage
To test all the routes, an E-commerce database was created and the database was seeded with data by running the command `npm run seed`. The server was then initialized by typing the command `npm start` and the PORT listened for requests.
